          <p>For  years, wealth and controversy have followed Chicago-based nursing home operators Morris Esformes and his son Philip Esformes, who was arrested in July in what prosecutors have called one of the largest health care bribery and kickback schemes in U.S. history. Their dozens of Illinois, Florida and Missouri nursing facilities have earned millions of Medicaid and Medicare dollars annually despite repeated federal law enforcement probes and Chicago Tribune investigations alleging substandard care and incidents when disabled patients were assaulted by fellow residents.</p>

              <p>A federal district court in Mississippi has issued an injunction blocking a new rule that would preserve the right of patients and their families to sue nursing homes over quality-of-care disputes. The rule, announced in September by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, would ban so-called pre-dispute binding arbitration clauses in nursing home contracts, which require patients and families to settle any dispute over care through arbitration, rather than the court system.</p>

              <p>An organization that advocates for better nursing homes has developed a series of online videos to help families choose nursing homes for loved ones. The organization, known as the Illinois Pioneer Coalition, advocates for “culture change” in nursing homes, including allowing residents to make more decisions about their day-to-day lives. The videos are available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-tVYUum7EIglOcLVCEp_JQ">YouTube</a>.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://www.illinois.gov/aging/Resources/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/2016-0929.aspx">Illinois Awarded $1 Million Grant to Pilot Person-centered Supportive Services Program</a></h3>
              <p>Springfield – The Illinois Department on Aging (IDoA) today announced the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the Administration for Community Living, has awarded the State of Illinois a $1 million grant. Through the grant, the Department will develop and pilot test person-centered supportive services that meet the needs of persons living with or those at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia, and their caregivers.</p>

              <p>Attorney General Lisa Madigan yesterday joined with 44 other states, Washington, D.C. and the federal government to announce a $28 million settlement with Omnicare Inc. over allegations the company solicited and received kickbacks from Abbott Laboratories in exchange for recommending and purchasing the drug Depakote for the off-label use of controlling behavior disturbances in nursing home patients with dementia.</p>

              <p>For the first time in 25 years, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued revised rules to improve resident safety. An important one of them is that nursing homes can no longer force residents or their families to sign arbitration agreements in their contracts. This then allows a resident who suffers from serious harm in a nursing home to have their day in court, rather than try to get justice in a secret non-public arbitration.</p>

              <p>Sometimes called elder orphans, seniors with no relatives available to help them manage aging and illness are a large and likely growing group, according to Dr. Maria Torroella Carney, chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, N.Y. Roughly 22 percent of adults over the age of 65 are elder orphans or are at risk of becoming elder orphans because they don't have spouses, children, or siblings who live nearby, according to an analysis by Carney and three co-authors that was presented at the American Geriatrics Society's 2015 annual meeting.</p>

              <p>New nursing home ratings published on a Medicare-run consumer website don't answer questions about the system's accuracy, a Democratic senator told Bloomberg BNA Aug. 10. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services changed the overall five-star quality ratings on its Nursing Home Compare website by including data from another five quality measures, an Aug. 10 fact sheet said.</p>

              <p>Standing before the religious icons that line his Ukrainian Orthodox church in Humboldt Park, the Rev. Nicholas Chervyatiuk has ministered to followers who arrived in Chicago as refugees after surviving Nazi Germany's prison camps. Now the Cook County public guardian is accusing the priest of improperly taking more than $500,000 from the savings of one of those displaced persons, a 93-year-old former church secretary diagnosed with dementia.</p>

              <p>In the years before Sacred Heart Hospital abruptly closed, a series of elderly nursing home patients were taken to the struggling West Side medical facility, where they were whisked directly into a room to be examined and tested. The reasons for admission were murky. The trips to Sacred Heart, situated in the Garfield Park area, often made little geographic sense. Many of the patients were mentally disabled and poor.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-nursing-home-lawsuit-0621-biz-20160620-story.html">Tribune: Nursing homes file suit to stop rival's expansion</a></h3>
              <p>Three nursing homes have gone to court to stop two projects that would bring new competition to the western suburbs. Community Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Naperville, The Springs at Monarch Landing in Naperville and Bria Health Services in Westmont filed two lawsuits last week challenging recent state approvals of proposals by a new rival, Transitional Care Management, to open facilities in Lisle and Aurora. The projects have been controversial in the nursing home industry because Transitional Care only wants to treat patients who were hospitalized but need short-term rehabilitative therapy before they go home.</p>

              <p>In essence, the bill allows older adults to remain at home and in the community by providing them with necessary services to maintain their independence. The Older Americans Act also saves Medicaid and Medicare untold millions each year.</p>

              <p>A "senior" version of "nanny cams" is about to hit Illinois nursing homes. As of Jan. 1 [2016], a new state law, the Authorized Electronic Monitoring in Long-Term Care Facilities Act allows video or audio recording devices to be placed in Illinois nursing home rooms to monitor treatment.</p>
