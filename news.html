          <p>Despite objections from senior advocates, Gov. Bruce Rauner’s administration is forging ahead with a cost-cutting plan to dramatically alter how older adults receive services intended to keep them from needing to go into nursing homes. Rauner’s team is projecting it can save $120 million a year by reducing the number of hours state-paid home care workers are needed in the homes of elderly individuals by substituting “flexible” alternatives. Opponents, including AARP, say the plan in reality is a reckless reduction of services that will result in higher costs to the state by forcing more Illinois residents into expensive nursing home care.</p>

           <p>THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT, which squeaked through the House of Representatives on Thursday, is terrible for many Americans in many ways. But what’s gotten almost no attention is the horrendous effect it could have on Americans in nursing homes. Daniel Webster, a Republican representative from the 11th Congressional District in central Florida, acknowledged this when he announced he would vote for the AHCA. “I have been very concerned about Florida’s Medicaid-funded nursing home beds,” Webster said. “These are critical to the access some of our senior population has to our nursing homes.”</p>

           <p>The potential repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is as much about municipal budgets and economics as it is about the individuals who rely on it for coverage. Federal Medicaid reimbursements, newly created preventive care grants, and financial incentives for neighborhood clinics have been a boon for Illinois hospitals and health centers. <a href="http://thedailyline.net/other/04/16/2017/special-what-do-we-stand-to-lose-from-an-aca-repeal/">In a special 36 minute episode of The Aldercast, we take a deeper dive into this topic to explain what the healthcare landscape was like in Illinois before the ACA, how it changed, and what taxpayers, governments, and providers stand to lose from a potential repeal</a>. </p>

           <p>Some of the victims can't speak. They rely on walkers and wheelchairs to leave their beds. They have been robbed of their memories. They come to nursing homes to be cared for. Instead, they are sexually assaulted. The unthinkable is happening at facilities throughout the country: Vulnerable seniors are being raped and sexually abused by the very people paid to care for them.[Article mentions Illinois further down]</p>

          <p>Home health agencies will be required to become more responsive to patients and their caregivers under the first major overhaul of rules governing these organizations in almost 30 years. The federal regulations, published last month, specify the conditions under which 12,600 home health agencies can participate in Medicare and Medicaid, serving more than 5 million seniors and younger adults with disabilities through these government programs.</p>

          <p>...Will the new requirements help improve care for the country’s 1.4 million nursing home residents — perhaps raise the report card grade to a solid B? “From our perspective, it’s a mixed bag,” Ms. Grant said. Residents and families will most likely appreciate some of these changes once they are in place. But the regulations disappointed nursing associations and many advocates by declining to set minimum staffing standards. And one key provision has already been stopped in its tracks by a lawsuit. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/health/nursing-home-regulations.html?_r=0">A look at some particulars...</a></p>

          <p>Dr. Anitha Rao has seen this problem firsthand: She's just one of 1,000 physicians in the world with specialized training in dementia and geriatric neurology. Rao is now launching a startup in hopes of improving dementia care through technology. Rao is the cofounder of Neurocern, a platform that uses proprietary algorithms to analyze symptoms in order to provide diagnostic guidance for doctors and a personalized care plan for patients. Rao hopes this solution will be particularly helpful to families without access to specialists and caregiving advice.</p>

          <p>A Chicago appellate panel has affirmed a lower court finding that a suit lodged by scores of nursing homes, alleging Illinois state government excessively cut its Medicaid reimbursements to the nursing facilities, should be pursued in the Illinois Court of Claims rather than Cook County Circuit Court, because the state did not overstep its authority as to how it calculated the reductions.</p>

          <p>At age 88, Elizabeth Fee looked pregnant, her belly swollen after days of intestinal ailments and nausea. A nurse heard a scream from Fee's room in a nursing home and found her retching "like a faucet" before she passed out. The facility where she died in 2012 was affiliated with a respected San Francisco hospital [...] Fee had just undergone hip surgery at the hospital, and her family, pleased with her care, said they chose the nursing home with the hospital's encouragement. Laura Rees, Fee's elder daughter, said she was never told that the nursing home had received Medicare's worst rating for quality - one star. Nor, she said, was she told that state inspectors had repeatedly cited the facility for substandard care, including delayed responses to calls for aid, disrespectful behavior toward patients and displaying insufficient interest in patients' pain.</p>

          <p>The son of a 63-year-old woman who died last year at a south suburban nursing home claims she was sexually assaulted at some point during her seven-week stay at the facility. The woman, who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease, was admitted Dec. 7, 2014, to GlenShire Nursing and Rehabilitation Centre [...] The suit claims the woman “developed a sexually transmitted disease as a result of being raped” while admitted, but does not specify when the alleged attack happened or who carried it out.</p>

          <p>Newly elected Champaign County Board Chair C. Pius Weibel said last week that he wanted to review the numbers from the Nov. 8 vote on the quarter-cent increase in the county sales tax for facilities in advance of Tuesday's special board study session on the county nursing home. It shouldn't take long. Not only did the proposal lose countywide, 70 percent to 30 percent, but it lost in every part of the county — Champaign, Urbana, suburban areas, rural areas — and it lost in every precinct.</p>

          <p>Hospitals have long been reluctant to share with patients their assessments of which nursing homes are best because of a Medicare requirement that patients' choices can't be restricted. [...] But hospitals' tight-lipped approach to sharing quality information may soon be changed. The Obama administration is rewriting those rules, not just for patients going to nursing homes but also those headed home or to another type of health facility.</p>

          <p>State and federal health officials are seeking penalties totaling more than $100,000 from a North Side nursing home after five residents overdosed on heroin inside the facility in February, the Tribune has learned. The residents of Continental Nursing & Rehabilitation Center were hospitalized and recovered, but at least two used heroin again hours after they were returned to the facility, even though they were supposed to be on close watch, Illinois public health department inspectors allege. One of the two overdosed again.</p>

          <p>For  years, wealth and controversy have followed Chicago-based nursing home operators Morris Esformes and his son Philip Esformes, who was arrested in July in what prosecutors have called one of the largest health care bribery and kickback schemes in U.S. history. Their dozens of Illinois, Florida and Missouri nursing facilities have earned millions of Medicaid and Medicare dollars annually despite repeated federal law enforcement probes and Chicago Tribune investigations alleging substandard care and incidents when disabled patients were assaulted by fellow residents.</p>

          <p>A federal district court in Mississippi has issued an injunction blocking a new rule that would preserve the right of patients and their families to sue nursing homes over quality-of-care disputes. The rule, announced in September by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, would ban so-called pre-dispute binding arbitration clauses in nursing home contracts, which require patients and families to settle any dispute over care through arbitration, rather than the court system.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 25 years, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued revised rules to improve resident safety. An important one of them is that nursing homes can no longer force residents or their families to sign arbitration agreements in their contracts. This then allows a resident who suffers from serious harm in a nursing home to have their day in court, rather than try to get justice in a secret non-public arbitration.</p>

Roughly 22 percent of adults over the age of 65 are elder orphans or are at risk of becoming elder orphans because they don't have spouses, children, or siblings who live nearby, according to an analysis by Carney and three co-authors that was presented at the American Geriatrics Society's 2015 annual meeting.</p>
