      <h3>Overall: {{{overall_rating}}}</h3>
      <p>The overall rating is generated through a process described <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/provider-enrollment-and-certification/certificationandcomplianc/fsqrs.html"
        target="_blank">by Medicare</a>. They start from the health inspection
        rating, and then generate the score by weighing in other factors as well.
        It is worth noting that we have chosen not to include the Quality Measure
        (QM) rating as it is entirely self-reported, but the QM rating is part
        of the process for creating the overall rating.
      </p>
      <h3>Inspections: {{{health_inspection_rating}}}</h3>
      <p>The health inspection rating contains information from the last 3 years
        of onsite inspections, including both standard surveys and any complaint
        surveys. This information is gathered by trained, objective inspectors
        who go onsite to the nursing home and follow a specific process to
        determine the extent to which a nursing home has met Medicaid and
        Medicare's minimum quality requirements.  The most recent survey findings
        are weighted more than the prior two years.  More than 180,000 onsite
        reviews are used in the health inspection scoring nationally.
      </p>
      <h3>Staffing: {{{staffing_rating}}}</h3>
      <p>The staffing rating has information about the number of hours of care
        provided on average to each resident each day by nursing staff. This
        rating considers differences in the levels of residents' care need in
        each nursing home. For example, a nursing home with residents who had
        more severe needs would be expected to have more nursing staff than a
        nursing home where the resident needs were not as high. All information
        on staffing is submitted by the facility.
      </p>
      <h3>Nurses: {{{rn_staffing_rating}}}</h3>
      <p>The nurses rating is similar to the staffing rating, but specifically
        to data relating to Registered Nurses (RNs). Like the general staffing
        rating, RN staffing information is submitted by the facility and adjusted
        for the needs of the nursing home residents.
