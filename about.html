          <h1>What is this site?</h1>
          <p>This site was originally developed to be a tool to find the best nursing home you can afford, but once we saw the map we knew there was something bigger going on. Why are there so many nursing homes in our area with the worst possible rating? Is that normal?</p>
          <p>Illinois ranks near the bottom nationally for nursing home quality, according to <a fref="http://nursinghomereportcards.com">Families for Better Care</a>. The reason? Poor staffing.</p>
          <p>This <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-nursing-home-safety-gallery-storygallery.html">Chicago Tribune nursing home series</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/poolcar4">David Jackson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/garyjmarx">Gary Marx</a> is a great place to learn more about the recent history of nursing home issues in Illinois.</p>
          <h3>where do you get your data?</h3>
          <p>We're showing you the <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Nursing-Home-Compare/Provider-Info/4pq5-n9py" target="_blank">Medicare Ratings</a> for these places. This <a href="https://data.medicare.gov" target="_blank">Medicare Data</a> has received some <a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-33">deserved criticism</a>, but it's getting better.
            Here's a description of the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/provider-enrollment-and-certification/certificationandcomplianc/fsqrs.html" target="_blank">five-star quality ratings from Medicare</a>.

          <h3>How can we improve nursing homes and get rid of the bad ones?</h3>
          <p>Regulations, inspections and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/two-deaths-different-penalties-disparities-in-nursing-homes-oversight">fines</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>Want to know more?</h3>
          <p>We're not experts. We're just did a lot of reading, talked to some people and then made a website. Here are some groups who are working on this problem.
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.illinoiscares.org/">Illinois Citizens for Better Care</a> gave us the data on psych meds. Their website is a great resource for both families chosing homes and advocates.</li>
              <li><a href="http://sharenetworkchicago.org/">The SHARE Network</a> is older adults, caregivers, providers, and aging specialists working together to improve health on Chicagoâ€™s South Side.</li>
              <li><a href="http://illinoispioneercoalition.org/">Illinois Pioneer Coalition</a> has a lot of resources for families who need to find a nursing home. They also advocate for quality of life improvements.</li>

              <li><a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/nursing-homes">ProPublica Nursing Home Reports</a> is a great resource for national news on nursing homes.</li>

          <h3>Who made this site?</h3>
          <p>This project began with an August 2014 story in the New York Times by Katie Thomas called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/business/medicare-star-ratings-allow-nursing-homes-to-game-the-system.html?_r=0" target="_blank">"Medicare Star Ratings Allow Nursing Homes to Game the System."</a> The story got quite a bit of attention, including in Chicago's civic tech community.

            At <a href="http://www.chihacknight.org" target="_blank">Chi Hack Night</a> a group formed to build an app to do something about it.
            All the code is <a href="https://github.com/open-retirement/open-retirement.github.com" target="_blank">open source on GitHub</a>, and contributions are welcome!
