          <h1>What is this site?</h1>
          <p>This site was developed to be a tool to help people choose the best nursing home they could afford, but once we saw the map we knew we had a bigger story on our hands. Why are there so many nursing homes in our area with the worst possible rating?</p>
          <h3>Who made this site?</h3>
          <p>This project began with an August 2014 story in the New York Times by Katie Thomas called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/business/medicare-star-ratings-allow-nursing-homes-to-game-the-system.html?_r=0" target="_blank">"Medicare Star Ratings Allow Nursing Homes to Game the System."</a> The story got quite a bit of attention, including in Chicago's civic tech community.
          </p>
          <p>
            At <a href="http://www.chihacknight.org" target="_blank">Chi Hack Night</a> a group formed to build an app to do something about it.
            All the code is <a href="https://github.com/open-retirement/open-retirement.github.com" target="_blank">open source on GitHub</a>, and contributions are welcome!

          <h3>How do you know which one is better?</h3>
          <p>We're showing you the <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Nursing-Home-Compare/Provider-Info/4pq5-n9py" target="_blank">Medicare Ratings</a> for these places. This is the same <a href="https://data.medicare.gov" target="_blank">Medicare Data</a> referred to in the New York Times story. It's getting better, but it still has a lot of problems.
            Here's a description of the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/provider-enrollment-and-certification/certificationandcomplianc/fsqrs.html" target="_blank">five-star quality ratings from Medicare</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>Is that it?</h3>
          <p>We also want to highlight the huge differences in nursing home quality. It's not just a Northside vs. Westside and Southside issue, though those geographic measures of inequality are plainly evident here, too. You may find one of the best places in the city and one of the worst within three blocks of each other, and you can't always tell which is which by looks alone.
          </p>
          <h3>How can we improve nursing homes and get rid of the bad ones?</h3>
          <p>Two words: regulations and inspections.
          </p>
          <h3>What regulations do you recommend? Who should do the inspections?</h3>
          <p>We don't know. We're not experts. But we're willing to help people who are experts get something done. Here are some people who are working on this problem.
